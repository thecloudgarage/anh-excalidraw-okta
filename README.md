# Excalidraw with a TWIST!!!
Excalidraw is a beautiful attempt at collaborative whiteboarding combining simplicity and speed of latest technologies. The attempt is to mashup Excalidraw app (ReactJS + WebSockets) with OAuth2.0 authentication deployed on a NGINX frontend proxy-layer integrated with OKTA. In addition, we use this combination of frontend (NGINX-proxy-auth-layer) plus backend (excalidraw app) to be deployed on a cloud native platform like Tanzu Application Services.
